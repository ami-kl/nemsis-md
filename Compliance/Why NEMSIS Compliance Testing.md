The NEMSIS Technical Assistance Center (TAC), funded by NHTSA, is responsible for providing 
assistance to state and local EMS entities transitioning to a NEMSIS-compliant electronic 
Patient Care Reporting (ePCR) system. Ensuring the accurate application of the NEMSIS 
standard across the EMS software market has been accomplished through the use of a 
compliance testing process maintained by the NEMSIS TAC. The compliance process is offered 
to all entities wishing to develop a field-  or state-level software solution for collecting, 
aggregating and transmitting ePCR information. The compliance process is offered free of 
charge and can be accomplished in a relatively short period of time. 
A primary objective of the NEMSIS project is to maintain a national repository of ePCR data for 
reporting and research purposes. To date, 46 states and territories submit 25 million EMS 
activations (ePCRs) annually. Importantly, only software solutions that have tested compliant 
with the NEMSIS TAC are permitted to contribute to the national EMS repository. This rule is 
enforced for the following reasons. 
The NEMSIS project relies on forms of data transmission that require strict adherence to 
standards to ensure success. In addition, a strict structured XML standard for ePCR data must 
be maintained to ensure local EMS agency software and state and national repositories 
remain harmonized. Allowing untested software to participate in the NEMSIS program 
introduces the likelihood of variability that could quickly degrade the integrity of this working 
and successful project. 
The NEMSIS TAC is committed to providing all resources necessary to make compliance testing 
available to any and all software implementations interested in participating in the National 
EMS Information System Standards. For more information regarding NEMSIS compliance 
testing, contact our compliance team at nemsis@hsc.utah.edu.
