Introduction 
The Environmental/Food Allergies e suggested list has been updated to employ a two-tier choice hierarchy 
in an effort to make identifying and selecting an appropriate value easier for EMS personnel. The first tier 
represents a generic environmental or food allergy. The second tier represents a specific type of allergy 
within the generic environmental or food allergy hierarchy.  Additionally, more EMS friendly terms are 
provided.  Thus, EMS software implementing this list may provide an interface that first allows EMS 
personnel to choose a generic environmental or food allergy,  and then more specific environmental or food 
allergy options are provided to make the final value choice.  
 
eHistory.07 – Environmental/Food Allergies 
The code list associated with eHistory.07 (Environmental/Food Allergies) represents a list of values found in 
Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine -- Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). The process for gaining access to 
the SNOMED CT code values is provided below.   
Suggested List  
The suggested list can be accessed from the NEMSIS TAC website on the Version 3 Resources page:  
http://nemsis.org/v3/resources.html
.  The term types utilized for the describing environmental/food 
allergies are preferred terms   (PT).   
 
When the environmental/food allergy suggested list was developed,  the primary goal within SNOMED CT 
was to utilize “Clinical Findings” or “Disorder” codes to identify patient allergies.  For consistency in 
reporting, it is important that Software Developers expanding the list of environmental/food allergies rely 
on the use of “Clinical Findings” or “Disorder” codes.  If an appropriate code cannot be found among these 
code types, the Software Developer should contact the NEMSIS TAC, who will work with SNOMED to add an 
appropriate code to the SNOMED standard.

Licensed “Suggested Lists” 
The U.S. National Library of Medicine provides access to the SNOMED CT code values through the Unified 
Medical Language System (UMLS).  An applicant must accept the terms of the UMLS Metathesaurus License 
and create a UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) account for access to UMLS datasets and terminology 
browsers.  
More information can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html.   
A public site available to view SNOMED CT codes is the IHTSDO SNOMED CT Browser:

?.  Please utilize the United States edition identified by the U.S. flag.  
Conclusions 
By maintaining a single source of these data and making it available internally as well as to our customers, 
we improve our data quality and consistency. This will reduce reporting errors in data submissions provided 
it is used as part of our own and our customer’s data management best practices. 
Hierarchy Tier Graphic Example 
EMS personnel may first choose “Environment” within the first tier of Environmental/Food Allergies to 
document the type of environmental or food allergen.  Multiple second tier choices may appear including 
“Dust” and “Mold” to choose from as the specific allergy. 
A second example is choosing “Food, Other” within the first tier of Environmental/Food Allergies, then 
specifying “Dairy product” or “Gluten sensitivity”.
