Introduction 
The Medical / Surgical History suggested list has been created to employ a two-tier choice hierarchy in an 
effort to make identifying and selecting an appropriate value easier for EMS personnel. The first tier 
represents a generic medical or   surgical history category. The second tier represents a more specific 
medical or surgical history choice within the first hierarchy.  Additionally, more EMS friendly terms are 
provided.  Thus, EMS software implementing this list may provide an interface that first allows EMS 
personnel to choose a generic medical or surgical history, and then more specific options are provided to 
make the final value choice.  
Many thanks to Paul Sharpe,  former data manager with the Virginia Office of EMS,  for his work on 
developing a medical and surgical history list.  The NEMSIS TAC made slight modifications to the list he 
created for use at the national level. 
 
eHistory.08 - Medical/Surgical History 
The code list associated with eHistory.08 (Medical/Surgical History) represents a range of values found in 
the 10
th
 revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) Clinical Modification (CM) and ICD-
10 Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS).  
 
Suggested List  
The suggested code list is represented in the following ICD-10-CM ranges: 
 
ICD-10-CM Range ICD-10-CM Chapter & Description

Licensed “Suggested Lists” 
The U.S. National Library of Medicine provides access to the ICD-10 code values through the Unified 
Medical Language System (UMLS).  An applicant must accept the terms of the UMLS Metathesaurus License 
and create a UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) account for access to UMLS datasets and terminology 
browsers.  
More information can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html.

The NEMSIS TAC may only distribute suggested lists with specific value codes from the UMLS system to 
entities licensed through the UMLS system.  Thus, each software developer must seek licensing and provide 
proof of licensing before gaining access to all of the pre-defined suggested lists available through the 
NEMSIS TAC. 
Conclusions 
By maintaining a single source of these data and making it available internally as well as to our customers, 
we improve our data quality and consistency. This will reduce reporting errors in data submissions provided 
it is used as part of our own and our customer’s data management best practices. 
 
Hierarchy Tier Graphic Example 
EMS personnel may first choose “Cardiovascular” within the first tier of the Medical/Surgical History 
Hierarchy to document the type of medical or surgical history.  Multiple second tier choices may appear 
including “Heart Failure” and “STEMI” to choose from as the specific medical or surgical history. 
A second example is choosing “Respiratory” within the first tier of of   the Medical/Surgical History 
Hierarchy, then specifying “Asthma (Mild)” or “COPD”.
