Introduction  
The Patient Activity suggested list has been updated to employ a two-tier choice hierarchy in an effort to 
make identifying and selecting an appropriate value easier for EMS personnel. The first tier represents a 
generic activity. The second tier represents a specific activity within the generic activity hierarchy.  Thus, EMS 
software implementing this list may provide an interface that first allows EMS personnel to choose a generic 
patient activity,  and then a group of more specific activities within that generic activity type are provided to 
make the final value choice(s).  
eSituation.17 - Patient Activity 
The overall code list associated with eSituation.17 (Patient Activity) represents a list of values found in the 
10
th
 revision of the International Classification of Diseases – Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM).  The process 
for gaining access to the ICD-10-CM code values is provided below.    
Suggested List 
The suggested list associated with eSituation.17 (Patient Activity) can be accessed from the NEMSIS TAC 
website on the Version 3 Resources page: https://www.nemsis.org/v3/resources.html
. The suggested code 
list for eSituation.17 (Patient Activity) is drawn from ICD-10-CM: Y93 Activity Codes section.  
Officially any Y93 codes can be submitted based on the Y93 pattern.  The suggested code list is a trimmed 
down list identified to meet the majority of needs of EMS across the nation. Some states may identify 
additional activities for inclusion.

Licensed “Code Lists” 
The U.S. National Library of Medicine provides access to the ICD-10 code values through the Unified Medical 
Language System (UMLS).  An applicant must accept the terms of the UMLS Metathesaurus License and 
create a UMLS Terminology Services (UTS) account for access to UMLS datasets and terminology browsers. 
More information can be found at: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/umls.html.   
The NEMSIS TAC may only distribute suggested lists with specific value codes from the UMLS system to 
entities licensed through the UMLS system.  Thus, each software developer must seek licensing and provide 
proof of licensing before gaining access to all of the pre-defined suggested lists available through the NEMSIS 
TAC. 
Hierarchy Tier Graphic Example 
EMS personnel may first choose “Cardio Activities” within the first tier of Activity to document the activity 
the patient was involved.  Multiple second tier choices may appear including “Calisthenics” and “Running” to 
choose from as the specific activity.
