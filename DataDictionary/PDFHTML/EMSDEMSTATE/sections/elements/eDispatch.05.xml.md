Data Element Comment
The use of acuity values vary by EMS agency. Some systems may utilize fewer than four levels and some more. The use of
four levels is to capture the majority and allow for the inclusion of the NHTSA National EMS Core Content definitions for
patient acuity, specifically: Critical, Emergent, and Lower Acuity. 
Provided below is an example application only. This example bears no relationship to any particular federal, state, or agency
billing requirement. 
For EMS Agencies and CAD / EMD systems utilizing Alpha-Echo, Omega levels for determining the priority level for dispatch
of the EMS unit, the recommended mapping is: 
Echo = CriticalCharlie = EmergentAlpha = Lower Acuity
Delta = CriticalBravo = EmergentOmega = Non-Acute
Patient Acuity definitions related to "Critical, Emergent, and Lower Acuity" can be found in the National EMS Core Content
document from NHTSA EMS at  https://www.ems.gov/assets/National_EMS_Core_Content.pdf
For Air Medical Transports the most appropriate values choices should be limited to two: Emergent and Non-Acute.
