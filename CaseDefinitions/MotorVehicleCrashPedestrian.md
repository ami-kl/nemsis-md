Discussion 
For all “crash” case definitions, the following apply: 
The ANSI D.16-2017 Manual on Classification of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes glossary, “Characteristics 
of Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes,” was consulted in the development of the motor vehicle crash case 
definitions, with differences noted below. (Text in italics is quoted from ANSI D.16-2017.) 
Motor vehicle traffic crashes have a number of characteristics that are used to distinguish between 
motor vehicle traffic crashes and other events such as noncrashes, aircraft or railway accidents and other 
motor vehicles, cataclysms, and nontraffic crashes. The questions below address all the distinguishing 
characteristics of motor vehicle traffic crashes. If the answer to each of the questions below is “yes," then 
the incident is a motor vehicle traffic crash. 
1. Did the incident include one or more occurrences of injury (2.3.1) or damage (2.3.7)? 
• It is assumed that injury occurred, since we are looking at eInjury.01 Cause of Injury. 
Damage-only crashes are out of scope from a NEMSIS perspective. 
2. Was there at least one occurrence of injury or damage which was not a direct result of a 
cataclysm (2.4.5 Cataclysm and 2.4.9 Transport crash)? 
• This information is unlikely to be reliably available in NEMSIS data. 
3. Did the incident involve one or more motor vehicles (2.2.7)? 
• Cases that are specifically reported as not including a motor vehicle are excluded. 
However, sometimes EMS uses more generic ICD-10-CM codes that do not indicate 
whether a motor vehicle was involved. The case definitions for pedestrian crash and 
bicycle crash may include cases that did not specify whether a motor vehicle was 
involved. 
4. Of the motor vehicles involved, was at least one in-transport (2.2.34)? 
• This information is unavailable in the NEMSIS data. 
5. Was the incident an unstabilized situation (2.4.4)? 
• This information is unavailable in the NEMSIS data. 
6. Did the unstabilized situation originate on a trafficway (2.2.1) or did injury or damage occur on a 
trafficway? 
• Cases that are specifically reported as “non-traffic” are excluded. However, sometimes 
EMS uses more generic ICD-10-CM codes that do not indicate whether a crash was 
“traffic” or “non-traffic.” The case definitions may include cases that did not specify 
whether a crash was “traffic” or “non-traffic.” 
• The terms “traffic” and “non-traffic” are not further defined in ICD-10-CM. EMS may not 
interpret the terms in the same way as ANSI D.16-2017.

7. If the incident involved a railway train (2.2.5) in-transport, did a motor vehicle in-transport 
become involved prior to any injury or damage involving the train? 
• The case definitions may include cases where a train was involved in the primary crash 
event. 
8. Is it true that neither an aircraft (2.1.5) in-transport nor a watercraft (2.1.6) in-transport was 
involved in the incident? 
• The case definitions may include cases where an aircraft or watercraft was involved, but 
not cases where the patient was an aircraft or watercraft occupant. 
The intent of the “crash” case definitions is to cast a wide net. Users of the case definitions may choose 
to narrow the criteria for their specific purposes. For example, 
• To identify fatal crashes in a manner similar to the Fatality Analysis Reporting System, the case 
definition could be narrowed to only include patients who died during the EMS call. However, 
this would exclude patients who survived to the hospital and died later because of the crash. 
• To identify traffic crashes more strictly, the case definition could be narrowed to only include 
ICD-10 codes labeled as “traffic”. However, this would exclude records where the report did not 
specify whether the crash was traffic or non-traffic. Also, it is unlikely that EMS providers are 
highly trained on the differences between “traffic” and “non-traffic”. 
• To identify only those crashes involving motor vehicles more strictly, the case definitions for 
pedestrian and bicycle crashes could be narrowed to only include records where the ICD-10 
code indicates that a motor vehicle was involved. However, this would exclude records where 
the report did not specify whether a motor vehicle was involved. 
The ICD-10-CM codes selected for the case definitions for crashes are based on the lists provided in the 
CDC NCHS 2020 ICD-10-CM External Cause of Injury Matrix for Causes other than Poisoning. The NEMSIS 
case definitions for crashes implement the criteria in the CDC ICD-10 matrix, with the following 
exceptions and refinements: 
• The NEMSIS case definitions do not distinguish between accidental, self-harm, assault, 
undetermined intent, and legal intervention/war operations. Applicable codes from all intent 
categories are included in the NEMSIS case definitions. 
• NEMSIS data sometimes includes non-billable ICD-10-CM codes. The NEMSIS case definitions 
account for the non-billable codes and include the ones that would be consistent with the intent 
of the CDC criteria. 
The CDC Injury Matrix label for this case definition is “MVT-Pedestrian”. 
Codes for “Pedestrian on standing electric scooter” and  “Pedestrian on other standing micro-mobility 
pedestrian conveyance” were added to the CDC criteria in October 2020 and are included in this NEMSIS 
case definition.
