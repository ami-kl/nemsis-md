Overview 
The NEMSIS Technical Assistance Center provides case definitions for scenarios that are often tracked in 
EMS for performance improvement or research purposes. Each case definition includes specific criteria 
recommended by the NEMSIS TAC to promote consistency across the industry. The case definitions 
were developed through discussions with subject matter experts and consultation of published research 
studies and other resources. 
The case definitions are described in plain English as well as XPath and SAS code. Since the NEMSIS 
standard is XML-based, if there is any ambiguity or inconsistency between the plain English, XPath code, 
or SAS code, the XPath code is authoritative. 
The case definitions generally “cast a wide net,” in that they may contain records that would be 
excluded when applied to specific purposes. “General Filters” define criteria that can be combined with 
the case definition criteria to further filter records by the following attributes, for example: 
• 911 calls, interfacility calls, etc. 
• Transports, non-transports, etc. 
• ALS, BLS, etc. 
• Pediatric, adult, geriatric, etc. 
The case definitions are compatible with NEMSIS versions 3.4.0 and 3.5.0.
